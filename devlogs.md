Today was a good day. I set up the basic structure for the levels 
	- rivers are the paths,
	- convoys are the paths + enemies + speed + spawn_interval + count, 
	- waves and a list of convoys.

I really like this. It seems you can set up levels this way and really fiddle with the puzzle concept and remove the noise from the program.

I need to implement 
	- the wave preview,
	- the wave resolution,
	- the hp reduction,
	- and the game end
	
	Cheers
